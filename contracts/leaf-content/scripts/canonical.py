"""CAT-1 canonical bytes, tree hash, and generation digest.

These three primitives are normative: `jawakad` (the producer), the Jawaka
catalog readers, and CentralScrutinizer must all agree byte for byte, or
they disagree about which generation is current. See
docs/content-paks.md#canonical-bytes-and-digests.

Kept in its own module because both gen_content_fixtures.py and
validate_fixtures.py need them, and a second copy of a hashing rule is a
second chance to get it subtly wrong.

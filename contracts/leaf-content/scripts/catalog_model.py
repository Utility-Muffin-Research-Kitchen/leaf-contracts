"""Reference implementation of CAT-1: selector resolution, the two
validation levels, and the publication protocol.

The point of writing this out is that three processes have to agree --
`jawakad` (the producer), the Jawaka catalog readers, and CentralScrutinizer
-- and the failure mode when they don't is invisible: a user silently pinned
to a pre-OTA system list. Every path here therefore ends in an explicit
outcome with an explicit reason, and there is no "serve what we had" branch
anywhere.
